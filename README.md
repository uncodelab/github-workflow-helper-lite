# Github workflow helper - Lite üöÄ

A Bash script designed for managing Git repositories interactively. This script uses the **GitHub Flow** method, where there is one main branch (`main`) and two supported branch types: `hotfix` and `feature`.

GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where work happens in small, incremental changes. Here's how it works:

- **Main Branch**: This is the primary branch where the production code resides. All changes eventually merge into this branch.
- **Feature Branches**: These are created for new features or enhancements. They are prefixed with `feature/`.
- **Hotfix Branches**: Used for immediate fixes to the main branch. These are prefixed with `hotfix/`.

This GitHub workflow helper script is essential for streamlining Git repository management, especially when adhering to the GitHub Flow method.
It simplifies the process of managing branches, committing changes, and handling merges by automating these tasks. This not only reduces the likelihood of human error in complex Git operations but also significantly cuts down the time spent on routine repository maintenance.
By automating branch creation, merging, and cleanup, the script ensures that developers can focus more on coding rather than on Git management, while still maintaining the integrity of the GitHub Flow process where Pull Requests must be managed through GitHub's web interface.
